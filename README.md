# Action-Detection-Model

Project Summary

This action detection model project involves creating a system that can identify and classify various human actions from video inputs. The project utilizes a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques, leveraging several Python libraries to achieve accurate and efficient action detection.

Key Components:

1. OpenCV (cv2):
   - Used for video capture and processing.
   - Handles frame extraction and preprocessing tasks like resizing and color conversion.

2. MediaPipe:
   - Facilitates real-time pose estimation and landmark detection.
   - Extracts key points from human body poses to be used as features.

3. NumPy:
   - Supports efficient numerical operations and manipulation of arrays.
   - Used for handling and processing feature data.

4. pandas:
   - Provides data structures and data analysis tools.
   - Assists in organizing and managing datasets, including feature sets and labels.

5. TensorFlow:
   - Used for building and training deep learning models.
   - Implements neural networks for action classification.

6. scikit-learn:
   - Provides tools for model evaluation and additional machine learning algorithms.
   - Used for tasks like data splitting, model evaluation, and possibly implementing supplementary models.

 Workflow:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Capture video data using OpenCV.
   - Use MediaPipe to detect and extract key pose landmarks.
   - Organize the extracted features and corresponding action labels using pandas.

2. Model Development:
   - Utilize TensorFlow to design and train a neural network for action classification.
   - Optionally employ scikit-learn for additional model evaluation and comparison.

3. Evaluation and Deployment:
   - Test the model on unseen data to evaluate its performance.
   - Fine-tune the model as necessary.
   - Deploy the model for real-time action detection applications.

This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision and deep learning techniques to develop a robust action detection system, useful in various applications like sports analysis, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.
